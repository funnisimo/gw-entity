# Gamedata

The files in this directory are taken from https://github.com/angband/angband

We are going to use some of them to allow you to build your objects and entities in the same file style as Angband.

Clearly there will be differences, but the hope is that **MOST** (not all) of the same functionality will be available in a fairly easy to understand/use format.

## Conversion

To create javascript files from these, you can run the make-objects script from the command line. It will convert the object files that are in this directory into files that you can use in your project.

```bash
npm run make-objects
```
