## Introduction

**gw-entity** provides some core functionality for making simple 2D grid based games. It is designed for Roguelike games.

## General

The library has some utilities that are very helpful for developing games. It is the core of a set of libraries that combine to give a lot of the functionality that you need. However, it is designed so that you can pick and choose the parts that you want.
